iOS app using Swift 2 and Xcode 7
iOS app that allows users to switch betwwen two views. One view is a table that shows all the locations that the user 
"favorites". The user favorites a location by switching to the other view, which shows a map. This switch to the map 
is done by pressing the "+" button at the very top right of the screen. Upon reaching the map view, the user can long-press 
anywhere on the screen to add an annotation (A red pin showing the address of the place). Once this annotation is created, 
the address of the long-pressed location in real-life will be added to the table view. This creates a list of 
"memorable places" that the user can revisit that place by simply clicking on that entry in the table. The table always 
saves the data regardless of whether the user has the app open or not.


Uses: NSUserDefaults, geolocation/coreLocation, mapkit, gestureRecognizer (for the long-press gesture)


WARNING: I document just about every line of code in this project simply for the purpose of being able 
to re-read later at some point. I had been learning these concepts while writing the code so I wanted to 
be able to remember it whenever I opened the project. It may look sloppy...or very green...
